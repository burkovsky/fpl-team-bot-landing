# FPL Team Bot [@fpl_team_bot](https://t.me/fpl_team_bot)

Like most FPL managers, I mainly use the official app.

But I found myself wanting more consolidated data, stats and notifications in one place. I didn't really want to install yet another app (and especially sign in there), so I started working on a **Telegram bot** for myself.

At the moment it can:
- Notify about **point changes** during matches
- Send your **team points** for a gameweek
- Send **deadline reminders**
- Send daily updates for **price changes**, **players availability** and **top transfers**

Please give a try and provide any feedback.

Thank you!
